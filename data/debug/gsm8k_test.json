He then went on to get 2 more degrees in other fields for the same period of time.  He also got a graduate degree in physics, which took another 2 years.  How many years in total did Tony go to school to be an astronaut?",
    "output": "Tony got 3 degrees which each took 4 years, for 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 years spent.\nHe then got his graduate degree, which was another 2 years added to the previous total, for 12+2=<<12+2=14>>14 years in total.\n#### 14"

    "output": "Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\n#### 22"

    "output": "Three-quarters of oil from the initially full 4000-liter tank would be 4000*(3/4)= <<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 liters\nIn addition to the 3000 liters that were already in the large tanker, there are 3000+3000 = <<3000+3000=6000>>6000 liters in it now.\nThe tanker would be filled to half capacity by (1/2)*20000 = <<(1/2)*20000=10000>>10000 liters of oil\nThere are 10000-6000 = <<10000-6000=4000>>4000 liters left to reach half capacity.\n#### 4000"
